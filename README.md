# A-Modular-Hybrid-Simulator-for-LoRaWAN
Developed a discrete event, scalable, and opensource LoRaWAN network simulator, called Modular Hybrid
Simulator for LoRaWAN. The script of the developed simulator
is written in Python. The designed simulator consists of multiple
modules for the required actions of LoRa communication. These
modules are easy to understand and can be adapted to the
application requirements. As the developed simulator deals with
the IQ (in-phase and quadrature-phase) samples, it gives a
better understanding of the LoRaWAN (MAC) and LoRa (PHY)
interaction.
